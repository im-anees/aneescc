###### **1. THE PROBLEM**  
  
Current PKM tools behave like **untyped append-only datastores**.  
They accumulate information but do not:  
  
* structure thought  
* enforce semantic clarity  
* model idea evolution  
* prevent cognitive entropy  
* guide reasoning  
* support decision-making pipelines  
  
The result:  
users drown in fragments and cannot maintain conceptual coherence over time.  
  
This is the fundamental flaw:  
**Storage ≠ cognition.**

###### **2. THE SOLUTION (Co-Builder Version)**  
  
Origin is a **cognition engine** that provides:  
  
###### **A. Ontological Primitives (Embryos)**  
  
Typed units of thought that support:  
  
* merge  
* evolve  
* dissolve  
* stabilize  
* operationalize  
  
This replaces “notes” with *typed semantic entities*.

###### **B. A Lifecycle for Ideas**  
  
Every embryo moves through a definable flow:  
  
1. Capture  
2. Clarify  
3. Classify  
4. Compress  
5. Converge  
6. Convert (decision / output)

###### **C. A Semantic Constraint Engine**  
  
A layer that:  
  
* detects duplicates  
* enforces ontology  
* prevents fragmentation  
* suggests merges  
* surfaces conceptual conflicts  
* maintains structural coherence  
  
This is the part that turns Origin from a “tool” into **infrastructure**.

###### **D. A Universal Schema for Problems & Answers**  
  
An extensible schema enabling:  
  
* consistent problem decomposition  
* universal addressing of questions  
* combinable answers  
* sharable cognitive artifacts  
* a marketplace layer (long-term vision)
